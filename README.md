# FastAPI + PostgreSQL

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

# Installation Steps for My Project

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git
```

---

### 3. **Using Code Comments in the Script**

If the steps are closely related to a script, include the steps as comments within the script itself.

**Example (install.py):**

```python
# Step 1: Clone the repository
# git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
# cd project

# Step 3: Create and activate a virtual environment
# python -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)
# venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

# Step 4: Install dependencies
import os
os.system('pip install -r requirements.txt')

# Step 5: Run the application
os.system('uvicorn main:app --reload')
```
